## Back to School

So 3 weeks after the very successful pilot program (introduction to coding for the web) we are still running Thursday sessions in the Fresh Youth Academy at 25 Bertram Street. From the initial 5 we had 2 attendees today. One who has advanced far beyond the original scheme of the course and another who unfortunately came late due to a prior unavoidable appointment.

What can I say? With such a troubled group with a variety of issues I'm ecstatic that we still have their interest this far past the course dates.

But this is just a short post to stay updated with the classes. Covered in todays session:
- for loops structure in javascript 
- github repo's
- IDE online with Nitrous.io
- Twitter Bootstrap

But thats my promised post.
